    "### a: In your opinion, what were the most important turning points in the history of deep learning?\n",
    "In my opinion, the history of deep learning has several key turning points. Early neural networks and perceptrons introduced the idea of learning from data, but training deep networks became practical only after backpropagation was developed. The 2006 paper on deep belief networks and the term \"deep learning\" marked a significant turning point, separating it from traditional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, the success of GPU-accelerated CNNs could achieve better results in image recognition. And after few years, plenty of architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers were developed, which revolutionized natural language processing and sequence modeling. Now we Have ChatGPT and other large language models that have transformed how we interact with AI. Personally, OpenAI Five was the also an impressive shift, because now I might get to play against a bot that has 99.4% winrate.\n",

    "### b: Explain the ADAM optimizer.\n",
    "The ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is basically an optimizer that improves how neural networks learn. It is one of the most widely used optimizers in deep learning. ADAM optimizer is an advanced optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of two other popular optimizers: AdaGrad (moving averages of past gradients) and RMSProp (scaling updates based on squared gradients). It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter by maintaining two moving averages: the first moment (mean) and the second moment (uncentered variance) of the gradients. This means it can train faster and more reliably on large or noisy datasets.\n"
